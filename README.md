# Car-Sales-PowerBI





I am thrilled to share the success of our recent Car Sales project. Our objective was to revolutionize our client's operations using data analytics, advanced insights, and industry best practices to drive measurable business outcomes and enhance overall customer experience.

🚗 Background: This report evaluates the development and implementation of a Power BI Car Sales Dashboard for a global car dealership. The dashboard aims to optimize sales performance tracking and enable data-driven decision-making.

💡 Objective: Our goal is to design and create a dynamic, interactive dashboard visualizing key sales KPIs, enhance understanding of historical and current sales performance, and empower data-driven decisions for targeted growth and progress monitoring.

🚩 Problem Statement: The lack of real-time insights into critical sales performance indicators (KPIs) hinders informed decision-making, progress monitoring, and identification of growth opportunities.

👩🏻👨🏼 Customer Demographics:
•	Male customers dominated at 78.3%, with more purchases from Austin (17.3%) and Janesville (15.98%).

🔍 Further Investigation:

•	Provide filters for Body Style, Dealer, Transmission, and Engine.
Overall: The car dealership is experiencing strong sales growth, led by SUV and hatchback models. Regional performance varies, and customer demographics highlight a predominantly male clientele with income influencing buying behavior. Investigating the Week 40 sales dip might reveal valuable insights
